Hello, my name is Dan O'Neill.

3 words that describe me? Dreaded, Cocksure, Lugubrious

My favorite animal is named Reginald. He is staring at me from his tank right now, waving his venomous spurs menacingly. We just went for a walk/jog through the park during lunch. He is between 1 and 100 years old, we think. He looks very much like an elaborate hoax. I think I just heard the sound of an egg being laid, so I should wrap this up.
